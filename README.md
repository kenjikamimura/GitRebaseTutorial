# GitRebaseTutorial

## Introduction
This is a basic hands on tutorial on understanding **Rebasing** in Git. 

It will use the git command line interface and assumes that you understand basic git workflow and the commands. 

E.g:
- ```git init```
- ```git add```
- ```git commit -m "commit message"```
- ```git push```
 
## Step 1: Initialise your repositry

- Create a new repository by creating a folder in your file explorer called ```GitRebaseTutorial```
- Open up Git Bash and navigate to this folder and initialise your repository using the command ```git init```

## Step 2: Create a new text file
- Create a new text file in the the GitRebaseTutorial folder and call it ```TextFile1.txt```
- In this text file, write the text ```This is my first commit inside TextFile1```
- Commit this text file in git
    - In git bash, enter the command ```git add TextFile1.txt```
    - Enter the command ```git commit -m "Add first line in TextFile1.txt" ```
